I am a Ph.D. student in forensic pathology att UMU and currently working as a physician intern at Ume√•      University Hospital! I am bound for a residency in forensic pathology at the National Board of Forensic Science in early 2020!

I have a special interest in bayesian statistics and its applications in a forenisc setting. I mostly study organ weights and their interpretation in a autopsy setting but I also have an interest in the effects of chronic alcohol abuse.

Above you can find links to my research, github as well as shiny apps I've developed!
