I am a Ph.D. student in forensic pathology at UMU and currently working as a physician intern at Umeå University Hospital! I am bound for a residency in forensic pathology at the National Board of Forensic Science in early 2020!

I have a special interest in Bayesian statistics and its applications in a forensic setting. I mostly study organ weights and their interpretation in an autopsy setting but I also have an interest in the effects of chronic alcohol abuse.

Above you can find links to my research, GitHub as well as shiny apps I’ve developed!
